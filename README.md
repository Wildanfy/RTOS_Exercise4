# Task 3 : Priority Preemptive Scheduling
## Description
This project uses a real-time operating system (RTOS) with priority-based preemptive scheduling on an STM32 microcontroller to manage two tasks, namely controlling the LEDs. Higher priority tasks can interrupt lower priority tasks. This task shows how an RTOS works, where higher priority tasks always execute first, while lower priority tasks run when there are no more important tasks.
